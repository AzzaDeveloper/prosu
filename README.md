# prosu!
*v0.0.2*

---
prosu! is osu!, but written in Processing.

## How to install and use

Download everything and run it with Processing. No releases yet due to how buggy this is.

All lines of code in here is carefully commented so even the newest programmer can understand whats going on :D

Replace `test` in `Songs` to any beatmap of your choosing.

The current version **DOES NOT** work with sliders and should be fixed soon.

This is a side project written for fun and should work with all operating systems.

## This project uses:
- [Processing](https://processing.org/) as the main framework.
- [Rafis HDDT Skin (modified)]("https://skins.osuck.net/index.php?newsid=166") 
- A crappy beatmap made by me. Song is Outsider, by Eve.
