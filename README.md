# prosu!
*v0.0.1*

---

prosu! is osu!, but written in Processing.

# How to install and use

Just download everything and run it with Processing.

Replace `skin`, `test.osu`, and `audio.mp3` with something from a beatmap you choose.

The current version **DOES NOT** work with sliders and should be fixed soon.

This is a side project written for fun and should work with all operating systems.
