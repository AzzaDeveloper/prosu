# prosu!
*v0.0.2*
---
prosu! is osu!, but written in Processing.

# How to install and use

Download everything and run it with Processing. No releases yet due to how buggy this is.

Replace `test` in `Songs` to any beatmap of your choosing.

The current version **DOES NOT** work with sliders and should be fixed soon.

This is a side project written for fun and should work with all operating systems.
